# Practice Fusion Sample Application

## Introduction
This sample application aims to showcase some particular features from Sencha Touch 2.1 as described in the features list below. Each item is covered with some part of the code in this application. We provide as well a few code samples in this document to ilustrate the feature functionality when needed.

## App Structure
This sample application has been created using Sencha Cmd v3. The files and folders distribution follows the main skeleton defined by the Cmd tool. We have for instance, **view**, **controller**, **model** and **store** folders inside the **app** folder. We have added a **data** folder, outside the **app** just to keep some _.json_ files as fake data we use to populate stores/models.
